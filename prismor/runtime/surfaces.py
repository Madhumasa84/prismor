"""Which enforcement surfaces are actually governing this machine.

`contract.SURFACES` says what each surface IS and what it can do.
`integrations.registry.governance()` says which ones CAN reach a given agent.
This module answers the third question — which are switched on right now — by
reading the state the installers already write. It adds no state of its own.

The distinction that makes it worth having: "not governed" and "cannot be
governed" are different answers, and so is "governed by the mirror instead of
hooks". Collapsing them is how an agent Prismor deliberately does not support
gets reported as a coverage gap, and how an agent the mirror governs perfectly
well gets reported as unguarded.
