"""Password-gated self-edit window.

Prismor blocks an agent from editing its own policy (see the self-protection
rules in ``default_policy.yaml``). That is the right default and a bad absolute:
sometimes the honest answer to a block really is "add an exception", and making
the human retype the agent's work by hand is how a security tool becomes the
thing people route around.

So the block lifts, briefly, when a human proves they are present:

    prismor unlock            # asks for the password, opens ~3 minutes
    prismor lock              # close it early

Inside the window the agent may run `prismor allow` and friends. Outside it,
every route is blocked. The window closes on its own — an expiry that has
lapsed resolves to "closed" and deletes the marker, so a forgotten unlock heals
instead of quietly becoming a permanent hole (the same self-healing shape as
``pause.py``).

**What this is and isn't.** The agent runs as the same user as the human, so
file permissions stop nothing on their own and the grant MAC below is a
speed bump, not a wall. The real boundary is that agent actions go through
hooks, so the credential is unreadable to the agent (reading it is itself a
blocked route) and the grant only means anything to code running on the hook
path. An agent that bypasses hooks entirely was never governed by Prismor and
is not governed by this either.
