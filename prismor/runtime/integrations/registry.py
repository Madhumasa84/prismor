"""Loader for the Prismor integration registry (``registry.yaml``).

The registry is the single source of truth for which agents and frameworks
Prismor can intercept, the surface each exposes, and how blocking works there.
Both the docs matrix generator (``scripts/gen_integration_matrix.py``) and any
runtime adapter wiring read it through this module so there is exactly one
parser and one shape.

# ── governance surfaces ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Prismor can sit in front of an agent two ways, and they are not equivalent:
#
#   hooks   The agent calls Prismor before (and after) each tool call and obeys
#           the verdict. The agent keeps its own tools, everything it can do is
#           screened, and there is nothing to install into the model's tool
#           list. This is the better surface wherever it exists.
#
#   mirror  Prismor serves look-alike built-ins over MCP and the agent's own
#           are switched off. Buys what a hook cannot do — the tool runs inside
#           Prismor, so output can be REDACTED rather than merely refused — but
#           it only holds while the natives stay off, so it depends on the host
#           having a way to turn them off at all.
#
# Recommendation, in order:
#   * hooks when the agent supports them (complete coverage, nothing replaced)
#   * mirror when it does not (often the only interposition point that exists)
#   * mirror alongside hooks only when result-side redaction is worth the extra
#     moving parts — it is not the default.
