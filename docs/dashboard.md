# Dashboard & Sessions

Warden logs every agent tool call — not just the ones it blocks — to a local
SQLite store. This doc covers the three ways to read that history: the
**terminal dashboard**, the **local web dashboard**, and the **session**
commands for drilling into a single run.

Everything is local. `serve` binds to `127.0.0.1` by default; there is no cloud
component and no external service.

Implementation: [`warden/server.py`](../warden/server.py), session store in
[`warden/store.py`](../warden/store.py).

## Where the data lives

```
.prismor-warden/
├─ sessions/<session-id>.jsonl   append-only log, one JSON object per tool call
└─ warden.db                     SQLite, indexed for cross-session queries
```

Workspaces are registered as you install hooks, so the dashboards can aggregate
across every project you've protected.

```
   workspace A ─┐
   workspace B ─┼─► registered workspaces ─► status --all / dashboard ─► you
   workspace C ─┘        (warden.db each)
```

---

## Terminal: `prismor status` and `prismor status --all`

```bash
prismor status        # THIS workspace: hooks, mode, cloak, latest session, next step
prismor status --all  # ALL workspaces: risk, findings, mode, last activity
```

- **`status`** is the per-workspace health check — run it first every session. It
  ends with the single next action that matters (install hooks, switch to
  enforce, review findings, or "clean").
- **`status --all`** is the cross-project bird's-eye view: one line per registered
  workspace with its latest risk score, finding count, mode, and how long ago it
  was active. Add `--days N` to change the activity window (default 7).

---

## Web: `prismor dashboard`

```bash
prismor dashboard                   # opens http://127.0.0.1:7070 in your browser
prismor dashboard --port 8080       # custom port
prismor dashboard --host 127.0.0.1  # bind host (keep it local)
prismor dashboard --no-open         # headless: start the server, don't open a browser
```

> `prismor serve` is the deprecated alias of `prismor dashboard --no-open`.

Serves a self-contained HTML dashboard plus a small JSON API over the registered
workspace databases. The only external resources are a Chart.js CDN link and the
Inter / JetBrains Mono webfonts (Google Fonts) loaded by the browser; the data
never leaves your machine.

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | The HTML dashboard |
| `GET /health` | `{"status": "ok", "ts": …}` |
| `GET /api/stats` | Aggregate stats for the KPIs / charts |
| `GET /api/sessions` | Paginated sessions (`?page&limit&sort&dir`) |
| `GET /api/findings` | Paginated findings (`?page&limit&agent&severity&category&q`) |
| `GET /api/events` | Paginated events (`?page&limit&verdict&agent`) |
| `GET /api/supply-chain` | Supply-chain enforcement stats |
| `GET /api/agents` | Agent registry merged with per-agent call stats |
| `POST /api/agents/<name>` | Update per-agent controls: `{enabled?, mode?, iam_profile?}` |

If you run `dashboard` before installing hooks anywhere, it warns that no workspaces
are registered yet — install hooks in a project first to collect data.

### Agents tab

The **Agents** tab manages every agent that has run in a Warden-enabled
workspace (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, … — they auto-register on first run):

- **Enabled toggle** — the per-agent kill switch. Off = every tool call from
  that agent is denied with a CRITICAL `agent-disabled` finding.
- **Mode** — override the enforcement mode for one agent: `inherit (global)`,
  `observe` (log only), or `enforce` (block in real time).
- **IAM profile** — pin the agent to a least-privilege profile from `iam.yaml`.

Changes are written to `.prismor-warden/agents.yaml` and picked up by running
agents within 30 s. The topbar also shows the **effective enforcement mode**
(observe/enforce, merged across enterprise > project > global policy) at all
times.

## Drilling in: `sessions` and `session`

```bash
prismor sessions                          # recent sessions, this workspace
prismor sessions --findings-only          # only flagged runs, sorted by risk
prismor sessions --findings-only --global # flagged runs across all workspaces
prismor sessions --limit 50 --json        # machine-readable

prismor session <id>                      # full trace + findings for one session
prismor session <id> --json
```

Every shell command, file read/write, web fetch, and user prompt is captured, so
`prismor session <id>` is your forensic timeline for a specific incident — what
the agent did, in order, and which findings fired.

---

## Offline analysis: `analyze` and `ingest`

For CI gating or replaying an old trace against a newer policy:

```bash
prismor analyze                       # analyze the most recent session
prismor analyze --input session.jsonl # analyze a specific JSONL log
prismor analyze --sarif               # SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub Code Scanning
prismor ingest --input session.jsonl  # analyze AND store in the DB
```

`--sarif` output drops straight into GitHub Code Scanning or the VS Code SARIF
viewer, with full rule metadata.
